		One day I realized that a bit too often I feel angry or said, especially in the office.
		I'm not sure how severe the problem is and decided to track it.
		I build this service and started using it daily to record any good or bad emotions I had.
		After two or three weeks I checked the statistics and see that indeed more that 50%
		of recorded emotions were angry or sad!		
		Since then I try to improve my stats and things look a bit more green today...

		<h2>Record your mood</h2>
		<p>
		Record you current emotions with 1 simple click.<br>
		In addition you can provide a short (one line) description for recorded emotions.		 
		</p>
		<p>
		There are no rules when to record emotions.
		Personally I prefer to record it once when I fill angry or happy.
		But if you are using blogyourmood.com as a happiness index then maybe at the end of work (or day) is the best approach.
